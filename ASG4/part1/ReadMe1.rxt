Part 1:

In this part we have directly hardcoded all the FSM and simulated our buffer on all the FSM and accepted
the one with max length. Key words are already stored in symbol_table , so when we get a word we check if 
it is present in the symbol_tab as keyword or not and accordingly process

to run "./FSM input.in"
